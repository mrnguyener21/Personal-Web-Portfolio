IDEAS FOR PORTFOLIO
-LAYOUT
    -NAV BAR, ABOUT, WORK(PROJECTS I GUESS), RESUME, MAYBE A SKILLS SECTION?, MAYBE A CONTACT ME SECTION?, HAVE A LINKED IN AND GITHUB BUTTON
    -THE LAYOUT WILL A ONE PAGER AND THE NAVBAR WILL LET YOU AUTO SCROLL TO THE SECTION YOU CLICK
    -ADD IN A FEATURE FOR EACH SECTION TO SCROLL BACK TO THE TOP 
    -have cool transitions lol

-ABOVE IS THE FINAL DECIDED LAYOUT, FEELS MORE INVITING AS A PORTFOLIO. MAINLY THE LAYOUT AND COLOR SCHEME

-NAVBAR
    -About me, projects, skills, resume, contact me, linkedin(direct to my linkedin when pressed), github(direct to my github when clicked), resume(download my resume when clicked...is this going to involve some back end to store the resume and update it over time?)
    -will have the same color as the hello section of the page and the components will be in white. Have a white underline appear as we hover the different sections
    -figure out how to scroll to the appropriate section when you click on the component
    -turn it into a hamgburger menu for mobile
    -maybe use my name as a reload button for the site?
