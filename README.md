IDEAS FOR PORTFOLIO

-NAV BAR, ABOUT, WORK(PROJECTS I GUESS), RESUME, MAYBE A SKILLS SECTION?, MAYBE A CONTACT ME SECTION?, HAVE A LINKED IN AND GITHUB BUTTON
-THE LAYOUT WILL A ONE PAGER AND THE NAVBAR WILL LET YOU AUTO SCROLL TO THE SECTION YOU CLICK
-ADD IN A FEATURE FOR EACH SECTION TO SCROLL BACK TO THE TOP 
-have cool transitions lol
-EACH SECTION WILL ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN THE PRIMARY COLOR AND WHITE AS THE BACKGROUND

COLOR SCHEME
    -primary color: #02203c; will also use this color for white backgrounds
    -secondary color: #6868d1
    -third-ary color:#15314b;

-NAVBAR
    -About me, projects, skills, resume, contact me, linkedin(direct to my linkedin when pressed), github(direct to my github when clicked), resume(download my resume when clicked...is this going to involve some back end to store the resume and update it over time?)
    -will have the same color as the hello section of the page and the components will be in white. Have a white underline appear as we hover the different sections
    -figure out how to scroll to the appropriate section when you click on the component
    -turn it into a hamgburger menu for mobile
    -maybe use my name as a reload button for the site?
-WELCOME SECTION
    -Hi, my name's Victor Nguyen, a front-end developer and the latest addition to your team! Welcome to my portfolio and let me know if you see anything you like üëç
    -gonna be split in two, the left side will have a description above and a button label as  "RESUME" using the secondary color and the right side will probably just contain an image of super crazy code on a code editor(maybe screen shot some of my actual code and use that as an image LOL)
-ABOUT SECTION
    -DESCRIPTION(NEED TO PROVE READ, MAYBE EVEN TRIM?)
        -Even though I am a front end developer who inspires to be the best of the very best, it wasn't always that way. I actually started off in the accounting and finance field when I first entered the real world. There I went about the day to day tasks of bringing value to others by making sure that not only were their statements correct, but being able to efficiently and effectively create reports along with visual representations of their data so that we can strategically plan and execute for the future. Funny enough, what started as learning VBA for Microsoft Excel to further increase the value I can provide turned into an indirect discovery for my love of coding. 

        -Now I want to give value to others with not only my logical knowledge and mindset from the accounting and financial field, but to also provide value by giving others one of the best tools someone can have in the modern day. I want to provide others with amazing websites that fits their needs and criteria. In doing so, the value that person can now provide will have a greater reacher and in term give an even better experience as well.

    -split into two sections, the left side containing a card(use material-ui the same one as from the corona virus tracker) with my picture. Under it says Front-End Developer and we're gonna use the secondary color as an accent for the top of the card. On the right will have the description above

-SKILL SECTION
    -have cards that state the languages and frameworks that i know
    -alternate between secondary and third-ary color for the cards
