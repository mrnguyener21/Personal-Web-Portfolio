THINGS TO DO
NAV
    <!-- - the navbar is to high -->
WELCOME
    - the image is too big. doesn't convey a lot of info about you, it should only be a stylistic detail, not a full page.
    - buttons on welcome are lacking some padding and colors don't fit the design well
    - image covers the about me section header
ABOUT
    - MUI contains a lot of stuff, using it just for the card seems redundant, employers wouldn't like that a lot. 
    - the card design doesn't match
    - about me section is broken
    - the button for about me has uneven padding
PROJECT
    - projects heading is not centered
    - when you hover over the projects, the info goes outside of the div. (i would try to find a different implementation for that, maybe have everything visible from the start)
    - too much padding on projects bottom part
CONTACT
MOBILE
    - mobile phone number and icons can be styled better and can fit the design better
    (mobile version is better)
    - center the logo
    - make the text bigger
    - try to find a way to unzoom at the start
    - remove huge bottom padding on welcome section
    - it's hard for users to get to more informations about the projects because of the hover. again, it would make more sense to show everything at once

    - fix responsiveness (try replacing all the % in css since it can be hard to predict how it acts)
    - fix readme's of all projects on github (add meaningful information about each project) (reference to my chat app/covid tracker etc)
    - fix yugioh buttons in navbar, they're broken

- for width in css change vh to vw and adjust from there
-try applying some kind  of grid css
